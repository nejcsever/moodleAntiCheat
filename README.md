moodleAntiCheat
===============
This is a working prototype of a support system for online quizzes in the Moodle Learning Management System.
The system detects and to a certain degree prevents cheating on the quiz.
The detection takes place on the client side, in our case on the student's computer,
by using the JavaScript scripting language
and is forwarded to the server side for further processing. The functionality of the Google App Engine
enabled a free of charge deployment of a prototype that uses the Java programming language. The system allows
for creating quizzes, managing classroom seating arrangements and enables both realtime cheating alerts and post-quiz analysis of cheating.
The prototype is designed and implemented to support multiple operating systems and web browsers.
